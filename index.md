Hello guys! Welcome to a new blog on the series: Chess openings explained! Today I am going to show you to Adelaide counter-gambit which derives from the kings gambit again. The last one, the falkbeer counter-gambit was also from the king's gambit for black. This too is for black. If you want any white openings then you can tell me in the comments below.
Without further adieu, let us get started with this trap!
Before I start, I would like to give a brief introduction about this counter-gambit;
The Adelaide Counter Gambit is a solid attack against the King’s Gambit for black and begins with the moves:
1.e4 e52.f4 Nc63.Nf3 f5
When white plays the King’s Gambit they are usually looking to give up material and then have the initiative for the early part of the game. This defense turns the tables on white and gives black multiple attacking lines and control of the center. White has to be careful because if they don’t play properly there are many traps they can fall into. Below are differen

The Albin Countergambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves:

and the usual continuation is:

The opening is a gambit and an uncommon response to the Queen's Gambit. In exchange for the sacrificed pawn, Black has a central wedge at d4 and gets some chances for an attack. Often White will try to return the pawn at an opportune moment to gain a positional advantage.

In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings the Albin Countergambit is assigned codes D08 and D09. 

Although this opening was originally played by Cavallotti against Salvioli at the Milan tournament of 1881,[1] it takes its name from Adolf Albin, who played it against Emanuel Lasker in New York 1893. Though it is not played frequently at the master level, Russian grandmaster Alexander Morozevich made some successful use of it in the 2000s.[2]

The main line continues 4.Nf3 Nc6 (4...c5 allows 5.e3 because Black no longer has the bishop check) and now White's primary options are 5.a3, 5.Nbd2, and 5.g3. Perhaps White's su

## [Alekhine Defense]({{ "/openings/alekhine-defense/" | relative_url }})

![Alekhine Defense](/openings/alekhine-defense/alekhine-defense.jpg)



Alekhine's Defence is a chess opening that begins with the moves:

Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn centre, with plans to undermine and attack the white structure later in the spirit of hypermodern defence. White's imposing mass of pawns in the centre often includes pawns on c4, d4, e5, and f4. Grandmaster Nick de Firmian observes of Alekhine's Defence in MCO-15 (2008), "The game immediately loses any sense of symmetry or balance, which makes the opening a good choice for aggressive fighting players."[1]


The opening is named after Alexander Alekhine, who introduced it in the 1921 Budapest tournament in games against Endre Steiner[2] and Fritz Sämisch.[3][4] Four years later, the editors of the Fourth Edition of Modern Chess Openings (MCO-4) wrote: 
Nothing is more indicative of the iconoclastic conceptions of the 'hypermodern school' than the bizarre defence introduced by Alekhine ... . Although opposing to all tenets of the classical school, Black allows his K

## [Benoni Defense]({{ "/openings/benoni-defense/" | relative_url }})

![Benoni Defense](/openings/benoni-defense/benoni-defense.jpg)



The Benoni Defense, or simply the Benoni, is a chess opening characterized by an early reply of ...c5 against White's opening move 1.d4. 

The original form of the Benoni, now known as the Old Benoni, is characterized by 

This leaves Black a few options such as an early ...f5 and an early dark-squared bishop trade by ...Be7–g5, but has the drawback that White is no longer committed to playing c2–c4 after the response 2.d5. White may prefer to occupy c4 with a knight, or to inconvenience Black's development with an early bishop check on b5.

More commonly, it is reached by the sequence:

Black can then offer a pawn sacrifice with 3...b5 (the Benko Gambit), otherwise 3...e6 is the most common move, leading to the Modern Benoni. 3...d6 or 3...g6 are also seen, typically transposing to main lines, or to lines of the King's Indian Defense. 3...e5, the Czech Benoni, is now considered old-fashioned and allows White a clear space advantage.

Benoni (Hebrew: בֶּן־אוֹנִי‎; Ben-Oni) is an ancien

## [Bird’s Opening]({{ "/openings/birds-opening/" | relative_url }})

![Bird’s Opening](/openings/birds-opening/birds-opening.jpg)





Bird's Opening (or the Dutch Attack) is a chess opening characterised by the move:

Named after 19th century English player Henry Bird, Bird's opening is a standard flank opening. White's strategic ideas involve control of the e5-square, offering good attacking chances at the expense of slightly weakening their own kingside. Black may challenge White's plan to control e5 immediately by playing From's Gambit (1...e5); however, the From Gambit is notoriously double-edged and should only be played after significant study.

The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings assigns two codes for Bird's Opening: A02 (1.f4) and A03 (1.f4 d5).

The opening was mentioned by Luis Ramírez de Lucena in his book Repetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez con Cien Juegos de Partido, published c. 1497. In the mid-nineteenth century the opening was sometimes played by La Bourdonnais and Elijah Williams, among others. The British master Henry Edward Bird first played it in 1855 and continued to do so for the next 40 y

## [Bishop’s Opening]({{ "/openings/bishops-opening/" | relative_url }})

![Bishop’s Opening](/openings/bishops-opening/bishops-opening.png)



The Bishop's Opening is a chess opening that begins with the moves:

White attacks Black's f7-square and prevents Black from advancing the d-pawn to d5. By ignoring the beginner's maxim "develop knights before bishops", White leaves their f-pawn unblocked, preserving the possibility of f2–f4.

The f2–f4 push gives the Bishop's Opening an affinity with the King's Gambit and the Vienna Game, two openings that share this characteristic. The Bishop's Opening can transpose into either of these openings, and in particular a favorable variation of the King's Gambit, but with care Black can circumvent this. Transpositions into the Giuoco Piano and the Two Knights Defense and other openings are also possible.

The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings assigns the Bishop's Opening the codes C23 and C24.

The Bishop's Opening is one of the oldest openings to be analyzed; it was studied by Lucena and Ruy Lopez.  Later it was played by Philidor.  Larsen was one of the few grandmasters to play it often, a

## [Blackmar-Diemer Gambit]({{ "/openings/blackmar-diemer-gambit/" | relative_url }})

![Blackmar-Diemer Gambit](/openings/blackmar-diemer-gambit/blackmar-diemer-gambit.jpg)



The Blackmar–Diemer Gambit (or BDG) is a chess opening characterized by the moves:

where White intends to follow up with f3, usually on the fourth move.  White obtains a tempo and a half-open f-file in return for a pawn, and as with most gambits, White aims to achieve rapid development and active posting of their pieces in order to rapidly build up an attack at the cost of the gambit pawn. It is one of the few gambits available to White after 1.d4.[1]

The Blackmar–Diemer Gambit arose as a development of the earlier Blackmar Gambit, named after Armand Blackmar, a relatively little-known New Orleans player of the late 19th century who popularized its characteristic moves (1.d4 d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.f3) and was the first player to publish analysis of the opening.[2] The popularity of the original Blackmar Gambit, however, was short lived, as it was basically unsound, allowing Black to secure a superior position after White's immediate 3.f3 with 3...e5!. In 1889, Ignatz von Popiel came up with

## [Bogo Indian Defense]({{ "/openings/bogo-indian-defense/" | relative_url }})

![Bogo Indian Defense](/openings/bogo-indian-defense/bogo-indian-defense.png)



The Bogo-Indian Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:

The position after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 is common. The traditional move for White here is 3.Nc3, threatening to set up a big pawn centre with 4.e4. However, 3.Nf3 is often played instead as a way of avoiding the Nimzo-Indian Defence (which would follow after 3.Nc3 Bb4). After 3.Nf3, Black usually plays 3...b6 (the Queen's Indian Defence) or 3...d5 (transposing to the Queen's Gambit Declined), but can instead play 3...Bb4+, the Bogo-Indian Defence. Databases suggest that the Bogo-Indian is played approximately half as often as the Queen's Indian.

The Bogo-Indian Defence can also arise via the move order 1.d4 e6 2.c4 Bb4+, the Keres Defence. 

The Bogo-Indian is classified as E11 by the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO).

The Bogo-Indian Defence is named after the Russian-born German master Efim Bogoljubow who is believed to have originated the opening and played it regularly in the 1920s. Subsequent prominent playe

## [Budapest Gambit]({{ "/openings/budapest-gambit/" | relative_url }})

![Budapest Gambit](/openings/budapest-gambit/budapest-gambit.jpg)



The Budapest Gambit (or Budapest Defence) is a chess opening that begins with the moves:

Despite an early debut in 1896, the Budapest Gambit received attention from leading players only after a win as Black by Grandmaster Milan Vidmar over Akiba Rubinstein in 1918.[2] It enjoyed a rise in popularity in the early 1920s, but nowadays is rarely played at the top level. It experiences a lower percentage of draws than other main lines, but also a lower overall performance for Black.[3]

After 3.dxe5 Black can try the Fajarowicz variation 3...Ne4 which concentrates on the rapid development of pieces, but the most common move is 3...Ng4 with three main possibilities for White. The Adler variation 4.Nf3 sees White seeking a spatial advantage in the centre with his pieces, notably the important d5-square. The Alekhine variation 4.e4 gives White an important spatial advantage and a strong pawn centre. The Rubinstein variation 4.Bf4 leads to an important choice for White, after 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4
