![Queens Indian Defense](/openings/queens-indian-defense/queens-indian-defense.jpg)



The Queen's Indian Defense[1] (QID) is a chess opening defined by the moves:

The opening is a solid defense to the Queen's Pawn Game.[2] 3...b6 increases Black's control over the central light squares e4 and d5 by preparing to fianchetto the queen's bishop, with the opening deriving its name from this maneuver. As in the other Indian defenses, Black attempts to control the center with pieces in hypermodern style, instead of occupying it with pawns in classical style.

By playing 3.Nf3, White sidesteps the Nimzo-Indian Defense that arises after 3.Nc3 Bb4. The Queen's Indian is regarded as the sister opening of the Nimzo-Indian, since both openings aim to impede White's efforts to gain full control of the center by playing e2–e4. Together, they are a well-respected response to 1.d4.

4.g3 (ECO E15–E19) has long been White's most popular line against the Queen's Indian. It contests the long diagonal by preparing to fianchetto the light-squared bishop. The standard response for Black thro

![Fried Liver Attack](/openings/fried-liver-attack/fried-liver-attack.jpg)



The Fried Liver Attack, also called the Fegatello Attack (named after an Italian dish), is a chess opening variation of the Two Knights Defense in which White sacrifices a knight for an attack on Black's king. The opening begins with the moves:

White has chosen the offensive line 4.Ng5 against the Two Knights, but 5...Nxd5?! is risky (5...Na5, the Polerio Defense,[2] is considered better; other Black choices include 5...b5 and 5...Nd4). Bobby Fischer felt that 6.d4! (the Lolli Attack[3]) was incredibly strong, to the point 5...Nxd5 is rarely played.[4] The Fried Liver Attack, however, involves the knight sacrifice 6.Nxf7.

The opening is popular with younger players who like the name and the aggressive, attacking style.[5] It is classified as code C57 in the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings.

The Fried Liver Attack has been known for many centuries, the earliest known example being a game played by Giulio Cesare Polerio before 1606.[6][7] Computer chess programs, including those on lar

## [Ponziani Opening]({{ "/openings/ponziani-opening/" | relative_url }})

![Ponziani Opening](/openings/ponziani-opening/ponziani-opening.jpg)



The Ponziani Opening is a chess opening that begins with the moves:

It is one of the oldest chess openings, having been discussed in literature by 1497. It was advocated by Howard Staunton, generally considered the world's strongest player from 1843 to 1851, in his 1847 book The Chess-Player's Handbook. For some decades, it was often called "Staunton's Opening" or the "English Knight's Game" as a result. Today, it is usually known by the name of Domenico Lorenzo Ponziani, whose main contribution to the opening was his introduction, in 1769, of the countergambit 3...f5!?

The opening is now considered inferior to 3.Bb5, the Ruy Lopez, and 3.Bc4, the Italian Game, and is accordingly rarely seen today at any level of play. Magnus Carlsen used it for a victory in 2013.[1] Black's main responses are 3...Nf6, leading to quiet play, and 3...d5, leading to sharp play. Ponziani's countergambit 3...f5!? was successfully played in the grandmaster game Hikaru Nakamura–Julio Becerra Rivero, US Cha

The Nimzo-Indian Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:

Other move orders, such as 1.c4 e6 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.d4 Bb4, are also feasible. In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings, the Nimzo-Indian is classified as E20–E59.

This hypermodern opening was developed by Aron Nimzowitsch who introduced it to master-level chess in the early 20th century. Unlike most Indian openings, the Nimzo-Indian does not involve an immediate fianchetto, although Black often follows up with ...b6 and ...Bb7. By pinning White's knight, Black prevents the threatened 4.e4 and seeks to inflict doubled pawns on White. White will attempt to create a pawn centre and develop their pieces to prepare for an assault on the Black position.

Black's delay in committing to a pawn structure makes the Nimzo-Indian (sometimes colloquially referred to as the "Nimzo") a very flexible defence to 1.d4. It can also transpose into lines of the Queen's Gambit or Queen's Indian Defence. The Nimzo-Indian is a highly respecte

![Blackmar-Diemer Gambit](/openings/blackmar-diemer-gambit/blackmar-diemer-gambit.jpg)



The Blackmar–Diemer Gambit (or BDG) is a chess opening characterized by the moves:

where White intends to follow up with f3, usually on the fourth move.  White obtains a tempo and a half-open f-file in return for a pawn, and as with most gambits, White aims to achieve rapid development and active posting of their pieces in order to rapidly build up an attack at the cost of the gambit pawn. It is one of the few gambits available to White after 1.d4.[1]

The Blackmar–Diemer Gambit arose as a development of the earlier Blackmar Gambit, named after Armand Blackmar, a relatively little-known New Orleans player of the late 19th century who popularized its characteristic moves (1.d4 d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.f3) and was the first player to publish analysis of the opening.[2] The popularity of the original Blackmar Gambit, however, was short lived, as it was basically unsound, allowing Black to secure a superior position after White's immediate 3.f3 with 3...e5!. In 1889, Ignatz von Popiel came up with
