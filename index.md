![Kings Indian Defense](/openings/kings-indian-defense/kings-indian-defense.jpg)



In the game of chess, Indian Defence or Indian Game is a broad term for a group of openings characterised by the moves:

They are all to varying degrees hypermodern defences, where Black invites White to establish an imposing presence in the centre with the plan of undermining and ultimately destroying it. Although the Indian defences were championed in the 1920s by players in the hypermodern school, they were not fully accepted until Russian players showed in the late 1940s that these systems are sound for Black. Since then, the Indian defences have become a popular way for Black to respond to 1.d4 because they often offer a balanced game with winning chances for both sides. Transpositions are important and many variations can be reached by several move orders. It is also possible to transpose back into classical openings such as the Queen's Gambit and the Slav Defence; these are not considered "Indian" openings.

The usual White second move is 2.c4, grabbing a larger share of the cen

The King's Gambit is a chess opening which starts with these moves:

The opening is called a gambit because White sacrifices a pawn. In exchange for the pawn, White gets better development and opens up lines that can be used to attack/checkmate the black king. It was more popular in the 1800s, when many Black players did not know good ways to play against it.

## [Nimzo Indian Defense]({{ "/openings/nimzo-indian-defense/" | relative_url }})

![Nimzo Indian Defense](/openings/nimzo-indian-defense/nimzo-indian-defense.jpg)



The Nimzo-Indian Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:

Other move orders, such as 1.c4 e6 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.d4 Bb4, are also feasible. In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings, the Nimzo-Indian is classified as E20–E59.

This hypermodern opening was developed by Aron Nimzowitsch who introduced it to master-level chess in the early 20th century. Unlike most Indian openings, the Nimzo-Indian does not involve an immediate fianchetto, although Black often follows up with ...b6 and ...Bb7. By pinning White's knight, Black prevents the threatened 4.e4 and seeks to inflict doubled pawns on White. White will attempt to create a pawn centre and develop their pieces to prepare for an assault on the Black position.

Black's delay in committing to a pawn structure makes the Nimzo-Indian (sometimes colloquially referred to as the "Nimzo") a very flexible defence to 1.d4. It can also transpose into lines of the Queen's Gambit or Queen's Indian Defence. The Nimzo-Indian is a highly respecte

Die Grundstellung der Caro-Kann-Verteidigung nach 1. e2–e4 c7–c6

Bei der Caro-Kann-Verteidigung oder kurz Caro-Kann handelt es sich um eine Eröffnung des Schachspiels. Sie zählt zu den Halboffenen Spielen und ist in den ECO-Codes unter den Schlüsseln B10 bis B19 klassifiziert. Benannt wurde sie nach dem englischen Schachspieler Horatio Caro und dem österreichischen Schachspieler Marcus Kann.

Die Grundstellung der Caro-Kann-Verteidigung entsteht nach den Zügen (in algebraischer Notation):

1. e2–e4 c7–c6

Eine erste überlieferte Partie mit dieser Eröffnung wurde bereits 1847 gespielt. Der Name „Caro's Eröffnung“ geht auf eine 1886 in der Berliner wöchentlichen Schachzeitung Brüderschaft veröffentlichte Analyse durch Horatio Caro zurück. Auch der Wiener Schachmeister Marcus Kann wandte die Eröffnung an. Den Doppelnamen aus Caro und Kann verwendete 1890 erstmals Curt von Bardeleben in einem Beitrag für die Deutsche Schachzeitung, wo er von einer „Eröffnung Caro-Kann“ sprach. Die heutige

## [English Opening]({{ "/openings/english-opening/" | relative_url }})

![English Opening](/openings/english-opening/english-opening.jpg)



The opening is the initial stage of a chess game. It usually consists of established theory. The other phases are the middlegame and the endgame.[1] Many opening sequences, known as openings, have standard names such as "Sicilian Defense". The Oxford Companion to Chess lists 1,327 named openings and variants, and there are many others with varying degrees of common usage.[2]

Opening moves that are considered standard are referred to as "book moves", or simply "book".[3] When a game begins to deviate from known opening theory, the players are said to be "out of book".[3] In some openings, book lines have been worked out for over 30 moves, such as some lines in the classical King's Indian Defense and in the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defense.[4]

Professional chess players spend years studying openings, and they continue doing so throughout their careers as opening theory continues to evolve. Players at the club level also study openings, but the importance of the opening phase i

This gambit is referenced in an old french book by Tartakower "Le bréviaire des échecs", he called it "le gambit sicilien", another reference can be found in the Fine book "The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings", perhaps these two references could be added in the article.

The Tartakower book was translated into engish, the title is "A breviary of chess".

Sicilian Wing Gambit: Like the aritcle suggests, it's not the most logical responce to C5 and so it has largely fallen out of use. Therein lies some of its attraction, however. If you become familiar with it, your knowledge of an odd opening line might prove an advantage, especially over

## [The Three Knights Game]({{ "/openings/the-three-knights-game/" | relative_url }})

![The Three Knights Game](/openings/the-three-knights-game/the-three-knights-game.png)



The knight (♘, ♞) is a piece in the game of chess, represented by a horse's head and neck. It moves two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically, jumping over other pieces. Each player starts the game with two knights on the b- and g-files, each located between a rook and a bishop.[1]

Compared to other chess pieces, the knight's movement is unique: it moves two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically (with both forming the shape of a capital L). Consequently, a knight alternates between light and dark squares with each move.[2] When moving, the knight can jump over pieces to reach its destination.[a][b][4] Knights capture in the same way, replacing the enemy piece on the square and removing it from the board. A knight can have up to eight available moves at once. Knights and pawns are the only pieces that can be moved in the chess starting position.[4]

## [Slav Defense]({{ "/openings/slav-defense/" | relative_url }})

![Slav Defense](/openings/slav-defense/slav-defense.jpg)



The Semi-Slav Defense is a variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined chess opening defined by the position reached after the moves:

The position may readily be reached by a number of different move orders. Black's supporting pawns resemble a mixture of the Orthodox Queen's Gambit Declined, e6, and the Slav Defense, c6.

Black is threatening to capture the white pawn on c4 and hold it with ...b7–b5. White can avoid this in a number of ways. About 80% of games continue 5.Bg5 or 5.e3: the former constitutes a sharp pawn sacrifice, while the latter restricts the dark-squared bishop from its natural development to g5. Other possible moves are 5.Qb3, 5.g3 and 5.cxd5, the last of which, after 5...exd5, leads to a line of the QGD Exchange Variation where White's early Nf3 enables Black's queen bishop to freely develop, which should give equality (ECO codes D43 and D45). 5.Bf4 is considered somewhat inaccurate, as 5...dxc4 is favorable for Black.

The Semi-Slav is designated by codes D43 throug
