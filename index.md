![Adelaide Counter Gambit](/openings/adelaide-counter-gambit/adelaide-counter-gambit.png)




The Adelaide Counter Gambit is a solid attack against the King’s Gambit for black and begins with the moves:
1.e4 e5
2.f4 Nc6
3.Nf3 f5
When white plays the King’s Gambit they are usually looking to give up material and then have the initiative for the early part of the game. This defense turns the tables on white and gives black multiple attacking lines and control of the center. White has to be careful because if they don’t play properly there are many traps they can fall into. Below are different options they have after 3…f5.
4.exf5
This is the main line and best option for white. Black should continue with 4…e4. It keeps black with two central pawns and attacks the knight from white.
White can play Ne5 and exchange knights or play Ng5 and attack black’s pawn on e4. Black from here needs to play Nf6 because d5 in this spot leaves black vulnerable to Qh5+.
The move d5 now controls the center of the board for black and opens up the light squared bishop to attack the pawn on f5. Most o

The Albin Countergambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves:

and the usual continuation is:

The opening is a gambit and an uncommon response to the Queen's Gambit. In exchange for the sacrificed pawn, Black has a central wedge at d4 and gets some chances for an attack. Often White will try to return the pawn at an opportune moment to gain a positional advantage.

In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings the Albin Countergambit is assigned codes D08 and D09. 

Although this opening was originally played by Cavallotti against Salvioli at the Milan tournament of 1881,[1] it takes its name from Adolf Albin, who played it against Emanuel Lasker in New York 1893. Though it is not played frequently at the master level, Russian grandmaster Alexander Morozevich made some successful use of it in the 2000s.[2]

The main line continues 4.Nf3 Nc6 (4...c5 allows 5.e3 because Black no longer has the bishop check) and now White's primary options are 5.a3, 5.Nbd2, and 5.g3. Perhaps White's su

## [Alekhine Defense]({{ "/openings/alekhine-defense/" | relative_url }})

![Alekhine Defense](/openings/alekhine-defense/alekhine-defense.jpg)



Alekhine's Defense is a hypermodern response to 1.e4. Black lets White establish a presence in the center with the goal of proving it overextended. Although 1...Nf6 is only Black's eighth-most popular response to 1.e4, it scores as well as some much more common moves like the #3 French (1...e6) and #5 Pirc (1...d6).
The Alekhine Defense is 1.e4 Nf6. Games almost always continue 2.e5 Nd5 followed mostly by 3.d4 d6. Black's third move is the first little poke at White's center.
White has two main fourth moves in Alekhine's Defense: 4.Nf3, the Modern Variation, and 4.c4 Nb6, which turns into the Exchange Variation after 5.exd6 or the Four Pawns Attack after 5.f4.
White and Black have the same main goals in each variation: White is trying to hold ground in the center and Black is trying to take it down.
The Modern Variation is White's most popular choice, focusing on development to support the center with pieces. It is called the Modern in comparison to the more classical approach of conti

## [Benoni Defense]({{ "/openings/benoni-defense/" | relative_url }})

![Benoni Defense](/openings/benoni-defense/benoni-defense.jpg)



The Benoni Defense, or simply the Benoni, is a chess opening characterized by an early reply of ...c5 against White's opening move 1.d4. 

The original form of the Benoni, now known as the Old Benoni, is characterized by 

This leaves Black a few options such as an early ...f5 and an early dark-squared bishop trade by ...Be7–g5, but has the drawback that White is no longer committed to playing c2–c4 after the response 2.d5. White may prefer to occupy c4 with a knight, or to inconvenience Black's development with an early bishop check on b5.

More commonly, it is reached by the sequence:

Black can then offer a pawn sacrifice with 3...b5 (the Benko Gambit), otherwise 3...e6 is the most common move, leading to the Modern Benoni. 3...d6 or 3...g6 are also seen, typically transposing to main lines, or to lines of the King's Indian Defense. 3...e5, the Czech Benoni, is now considered old-fashioned and allows White a clear space advantage.

Benoni (Hebrew: בֶּן־אוֹנִי‎; Ben-Oni) is an ancien

## [Bishop’s Opening]({{ "/openings/bishops-opening/" | relative_url }})

![Bishop’s Opening](/openings/bishops-opening/bishops-opening.png)



The Bishop's Opening is a chess opening that begins with the moves:

White attacks Black's f7-square and prevents Black from advancing the d-pawn to d5. By ignoring the beginner's maxim "develop knights before bishops", White leaves their f-pawn unblocked, preserving the possibility of f2–f4.

The f2–f4 push gives the Bishop's Opening an affinity with the King's Gambit and the Vienna Game, two openings that share this characteristic. The Bishop's Opening can transpose into either of these openings, and in particular a favorable variation of the King's Gambit, but with care Black can circumvent this. Transpositions into the Giuoco Piano and the Two Knights Defense and other openings are also possible.

The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings assigns the Bishop's Opening the codes C23 and C24.

The Bishop's Opening is one of the oldest openings to be analyzed; it was studied by Lucena and Ruy Lopez.  Later it was played by Philidor.  Larsen was one of the few grandmasters to play it often, a

## [Blackmar-Diemer Gambit]({{ "/openings/blackmar-diemer-gambit/" | relative_url }})

![Blackmar-Diemer Gambit](/openings/blackmar-diemer-gambit/blackmar-diemer-gambit.jpg)



The Blackmar–Diemer Gambit (or BDG) is a chess opening characterized by the moves:

where White intends to follow up with f3, usually on the fourth move.  White obtains a tempo and a half-open f-file in return for a pawn, and as with most gambits, White aims to achieve rapid development and active posting of their pieces in order to rapidly build up an attack at the cost of the gambit pawn. It is one of the few gambits available to White after 1.d4.[1]

The Blackmar–Diemer Gambit arose as a development of the earlier Blackmar Gambit, named after Armand Blackmar, a relatively little-known New Orleans player of the late 19th century who popularized its characteristic moves (1.d4 d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.f3) and was the first player to publish analysis of the opening.[2] The popularity of the original Blackmar Gambit, however, was short lived, as it was basically unsound, allowing Black to secure a superior position after White's immediate 3.f3 with 3...e5!. In 1889, Ignatz von Popiel came up with

## [Bogo Indian Defense]({{ "/openings/bogo-indian-defense/" | relative_url }})

![Bogo Indian Defense](/openings/bogo-indian-defense/bogo-indian-defense.png)



The Bogo-Indian Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:

The position after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 is common. The traditional move for White here is 3.Nc3, threatening to set up a big pawn centre with 4.e4. However, 3.Nf3 is often played instead as a way of avoiding the Nimzo-Indian Defence (which would follow after 3.Nc3 Bb4). After 3.Nf3, Black usually plays 3...b6 (the Queen's Indian Defence) or 3...d5 (transposing to the Queen's Gambit Declined), but can instead play 3...Bb4+, the Bogo-Indian Defence. Databases suggest that the Bogo-Indian is played approximately half as often as the Queen's Indian.

The Bogo-Indian Defence can also arise via the move order 1.d4 e6 2.c4 Bb4+, the Keres Defence. 

The Bogo-Indian is classified as E11 by the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO).

The Bogo-Indian Defence is named after the Russian-born German master Efim Bogoljubow who is believed to have originated the opening and played it regularly in the 1920s. Subsequent prominent playe

## [Budapest Gambit]({{ "/openings/budapest-gambit/" | relative_url }})

![Budapest Gambit](/openings/budapest-gambit/budapest-gambit.jpg)



Gambit budapeszteński – otwarcie szachowe oznaczone kodem ECO A51-52, którego wyjściowa pozycja powstaje po posunięciach:

Debiut ten znany był co najmniej od końca XIX wieku, ale swą nazwę zawdzięcza budapeszteńskim szachistom Istvánowi Abonyi'emu, Zsigmondowi Barászowi i Gyuli Breyerowi, którzy w 1917 r. poddali go gruntownej analizie. Wkrótce grany był przez znanych arcymistrzów, szybko jednak znaleziono dla białych drogi do uzyskania przewagi.

Czarne już w tak wczesnym stadium gry poświęcają piona w zamian za inicjatywę, białe jednak zwracając go w stosownym momencie, uzyskują lepszą pozycję.

Współcześnie w partiach silnych szachistów gambit budapeszteński spotykany jest rzadko, regularnie stosuje go australijski arcymistrz Ian Rogers.
