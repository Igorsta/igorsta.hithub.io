Hello guys! Welcome to a new blog on the series: Chess openings explained! Today I am going to show you to Adelaide counter-gambit which derives from the kings gambit again. The last one, the falkbeer counter-gambit was also from the king's gambit for black. This too is for black. If you want any white openings then you can tell me in the comments below.
Without further adieu, let us get started with this trap!
Before I start, I would like to give a brief introduction about this counter-gambit;
The Adelaide Counter Gambit is a solid attack against the King’s Gambit for black and begins with the moves:
1.e4 e52.f4 Nc63.Nf3 f5
When white plays the King’s Gambit they are usually looking to give up material and then have the initiative for the early part of the game. This defense turns the tables on white and gives black multiple attacking lines and control of the center. White has to be careful because if they don’t play properly there are many traps they can fall into. Below are differen

![Albin Counter-Gambit](/openings/albin-counter-gambit/albin-counter-gambit.jpg)



I have seen the term "countergambit" and don't really know what it means. I know what it is, but I don't know what makes a move a "countergambit". I know of a few, including the Albin Countergambit, Panteldakis Counttergambit, and my most recently learned one, the Colorado Countergambit. In short, what makes a countergambit a countergambit?
This is a tougher question than it appears. I always thought that a countergambit was simply a gambit played by Black, but I vaguely wondered why no one talks about the Benko Countergambit or the Latvian Countergambit. It seems it more properly refers to a gambit played against a gambit: the Albin is played against the Queen's Gambt, the Falkbeer against the King's Gambit etc. This would suggest that some countergambits could be played by White, but I can't think of any.
Yes, but MOST countergambits take more than 3 moves. (In total by both colors)
Yes, a countergambit is a gambit offered by black.

## [Alekhine Defense]({{ "/openings/alekhine-defense/" | relative_url }})

![Alekhine Defense](/openings/alekhine-defense/alekhine-defense.jpg)



Alekhine's Defense is a hypermodern response to 1.e4. Black lets White establish a presence in the center with the goal of proving it overextended. Although 1...Nf6 is only Black's eighth-most popular response to 1.e4, it scores as well as some much more common moves like the #3 French (1...e6) and #5 Pirc (1...d6).
The Alekhine Defense is 1.e4 Nf6. Games almost always continue 2.e5 Nd5 followed mostly by 3.d4 d6. Black's third move is the first little poke at White's center.
White has two main fourth moves in Alekhine's Defense: 4.Nf3, the Modern Variation, and 4.c4 Nb6, which turns into the Exchange Variation after 5.exd6 or the Four Pawns Attack after 5.f4.
White and Black have the same main goals in each variation: White is trying to hold ground in the center and Black is trying to take it down.
The Modern Variation is White's most popular choice, focusing on development to support the center with pieces. It is called the Modern in comparison to the more classical approach of conti

Spice Up the Four Knights with the Belgrade Gambit!
Looking for a way to spice up the open games? Simon Williams, the Ginger GM, takes the quiet Four Knights opening and spices it up with a gambit, featuring a lot of his original analysis. Take the game out of theory and into a whirlwind attack as quickly as possible.
Here is what you will learn:
"My favorite GM to listen to so far. Simon is easy to understand, simple, and clear and he explains WHY each move is good. He gives advice and a review. GREAT VIDEO!!!" - Chess.com member WATERZZ
"Oh no!!  As a die-hard 1...e5 player, this line was one of the few lines that scared me.  I always brushed it off thinking to myself, "I don't have to worry about it, because no one knows about this move."  Now I'm worried again.  Great video!  Now I have to come up with something for it in case it's played against me." - Chess.com member Gartholomew

## [Benoni Defense]({{ "/openings/benoni-defense/" | relative_url }})

![Benoni Defense](/openings/benoni-defense/benoni-defense.jpg)



Winning with the Benoni Defense
1. d4 Nf6 c4 c5

4. Nc3
 This is the most common move for white after 3... e6. The next few moves are almost always played in some order: exd5 5. cxd5 d6 (locking the centre) 6. e4 (taking the centre) g6 (preparing to fianchetto the bishop). White here has 4 main moves, 7. f4 (the Pawn Storm variation, an aggressive response aiming to take even more space in the centre of the board and preparing a kingside attack), 7. Nf3 (the Classical variation, a more solid move and developing a piece), 7. Bd3 (the Penrose variation) and 7. Bb5+. Most of these variations can be dealt with the same response Bg7 followed by O-O for black, with moves such as Nf3 and Bd3 for white are usually played afterwards. With 7. Bb5+, blocking the check with 7... Bd7 followed by 8. Bxd7 Nxd7 and black is doing fine.

## [Bird’s Opening]({{ "/openings/birds-opening/" | relative_url }})

![Bird’s Opening](/openings/birds-opening/birds-opening.jpg)





Bird's Opening (or the Dutch Attack) is a chess opening characterised by the move:

Named after 19th century English player Henry Bird, Bird's opening is a standard flank opening. White's strategic ideas involve control of the e5-square, offering good attacking chances at the expense of slightly weakening their own kingside. Black may challenge White's plan to control e5 immediately by playing From's Gambit (1...e5); however, the From Gambit is notoriously double-edged and should only be played after significant study.

The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings assigns two codes for Bird's Opening: A02 (1.f4) and A03 (1.f4 d5).

The opening was mentioned by Luis Ramírez de Lucena in his book Repetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez con Cien Juegos de Partido, published c. 1497. In the mid-nineteenth century the opening was sometimes played by La Bourdonnais and Elijah Williams, among others. The British master Henry Edward Bird first played it in 1855 and continued to do so for the next 40 y

![Blackmar-Diemer Gambit](/openings/blackmar-diemer-gambit/blackmar-diemer-gambit.jpg)



The Blackmar–Diemer Gambit (or BDG) is a chess opening characterized by the moves:

where White intends to follow up with f3, usually on the fourth move.  White obtains a tempo and a half-open f-file in return for a pawn, and as with most gambits, White aims to achieve rapid development and active posting of their pieces in order to rapidly build up an attack at the cost of the gambit pawn. It is one of the few gambits available to White after 1.d4.[1]

The Blackmar–Diemer Gambit arose as a development of the earlier Blackmar Gambit, named after Armand Blackmar, a relatively little-known New Orleans player of the late 19th century who popularized its characteristic moves (1.d4 d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.f3) and was the first player to publish analysis of the opening.[2] The popularity of the original Blackmar Gambit, however, was short lived, as it was basically unsound, allowing Black to secure a superior position after White's immediate 3.f3 with 3...e5!. In 1889, Ignatz von Popiel came up with

Obrona Bogolubowa – debiut oznaczony kodem ECO E11, którego pozycja powstaje po posunięciach:

Ten sposób rozgrywania debiutu wprowadził Jefim Bogolubow w 1920 r. w kilku partiach, grano wówczas 4.Gd2 G:d2+ i, aczkolwiek gry te nie przyniosły czarnym sukcesu, to jednak idea wymiany czarnopolowych gońców na trwałe zagościła w praktyce turniejowej. Obrona Bogolubowa ma opinię debiutu pasywnego, ale trudnego do przełamania: najczęściej pada wynik remisowy, przy czym najmodniejszym współcześnie wariantem jest: 4.Gd2 He7 5.g3, gdzie czarne dążą do przełomu e6-e5 a białe, ze swej strony, starają się wykorzystać większą aktywność białopolowego gońca po jego fianchettowaniu.

## [Budapest Gambit]({{ "/openings/budapest-gambit/" | relative_url }})

![Budapest Gambit](/openings/budapest-gambit/budapest-gambit.jpg)



The Budapest Gambit (or Budapest Defence) is a chess opening that begins with the moves:

Despite an early debut in 1896, the Budapest Gambit received attention from leading players only after a win as Black by Grandmaster Milan Vidmar over Akiba Rubinstein in 1918.[2] It enjoyed a rise in popularity in the early 1920s, but nowadays is rarely played at the top level. It experiences a lower percentage of draws than other main lines, but also a lower overall performance for Black.[3]

After 3.dxe5 Black can try the Fajarowicz variation 3...Ne4 which concentrates on the rapid development of pieces, but the most common move is 3...Ng4 with three main possibilities for White. The Adler variation 4.Nf3 sees White seeking a spatial advantage in the centre with his pieces, notably the important d5-square. The Alekhine variation 4.e4 gives White an important spatial advantage and a strong pawn centre. The Rubinstein variation 4.Bf4 leads to an important choice for White, after 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4
